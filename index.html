			<h2 class="sectionTitle">What is Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)?</h2>
			<p class="sectionText">
				Per Wikipedia, "Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a computational
				method used for simulating the mechanics of continuum media, such as
				solid mechanics and fluid flows. It was developed by Gingold and
				Monaghan [2] and Lucy[3] in 1977, initially for astrophysical problems."

				CFD, of the sort typically encountered in the engineering domain,
				typically makes use of methods that discretize the fluid domain into a
				mesh. Once the domain has been discretized, the Navier-Stokes equations
				are then solved over the individual cells. These methods can result in
				very accurate simulations of the fluid behavior, but can require a
				significant amount of time to converge to a satisfactory result (for
				example, as a CFD analyst I regularly ran models which would take an
				entire weekend to converge).
			</p>
			<p class="sectionText">
				In situations where real-time, interactive fluid modelling is required
				(video games, real-time simulation, etc.), mesh free methods like SPH
				are seeing frequent use. In mesh free methods, rather than discretizing
				the domain into a mesh, the fluid itself is discretized into a large set
				of nodes, whose motion is determined by the interaction between nodes.

			<h2 class="sectionTitle">How does SPH work?</h2>
			<p class="sectionText">
				In SPH, scalar quantities like density are computed for each particle as
				a weighted sum of contributions from other particles. Weighting
				functions called <i>Smoothing Kernels</i> weight the contribution from
				each particle. A feature of the smoothing kernel functions is the
				<i>support length, h</i>, which is the radius surrounding each particle
				inside which the contributions from other particles are considered. If a
				particle is at a distance greater than the support length from another
				particle, no interaction takes place between the two.
			</p>
			<p class="sectionText">
				The general form of the SPH equation used to calculate some scalar
				quantity at a point <i>r</i> is shown below:
			</p>

			<p class="sectionText">
				Where m<sub>j</sub> is the mass of the j<sup>th</sup> particle, A<sub
					>j</sub
				>
				is the scalar quantity of the j<sup>th</sup> particle, &rho;<sub>j</sub>
				is the density of the j<sup>th</sup> particle, and W(r - r<sub>j</sub>,
				h) is the smoothing kernel with support length h.
			</p>

			<p class="sectionText">
				Fluid flow is described by the continuity equation, which ensures
				conservation of mass, and the Navier-Stokes equation which ensure the
				conservation of momentum. Because we are using a constant number of
				particles, conservation of mass is automatically satisfied and thus we
				can ignore the continuity equation. The Navier-Stokes equation for
				incompressible fluids is shown below:

			<p class="sectionText">
				The right-hand side of the equation contain three forces which influence
				the behavior of the fluid: pressure force (first term), external forces
				(second term), and viscosity (third term). Application of the general
				SPH equation to the density and the pressure and viscosity forces
				(external forces are just added to each particle) is shown below:

			<h2 class="sectionTitle">How is the algorithm implemented?</h2>
			<p class="sectionText">
				A general overview of the algorithm is laid out below:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>Initialization</b> - Particles are initialized with unique id, x,
					and y locations. A grid object is created which divides the domain
					into cells that are one support length in width and height. This will
					be used to quickly find particles which may be within the support
					length, reducing the number of particles that need to be checked.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Update Neighbors</b> - Particles are sorted into the cell they are
					currently occupying.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Update Density and Pressure</b> - The density and pressure of each
					particle is calculated. These values are used in the following force
					calculations
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Update Forces</b> - Force interactions between neighboring
					particles are calculated. External forces such as gravity are added at
					this time as well.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Update Velocity and Position</b> - Velocity is updated by adding
					the force acting on the particle times a small time step. The position
					is then updated in a similar manner using the velocity which was just
					calculated.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Boundary Handling</b> - If the position of any particle is outside
					the domain after the previous step, the position is adjusted to be one
					support length inside the domain. The velocity is then mirrored and
					dampened by a dampening co-efficient.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Draw Particles</b> - The canvas is cleared and the particles are
					drawn at their updated positions.
				</li>
				<li><b>Return to Step 2</b> - Return to step 2 and continue.</li>
